## Instructions 
Clone this git repository by clicking the green "code" button and copying the URL. Once copied navigate to the terminal and type "git clone (paste copied URL here)". Once this is done navigate to your code editor and select the correct folder of the clone. Once you are at the cloned directory type "npm install" in the terminal. What this command will do is install any package dependencies required (like Express) to your folder so you can use the program. These instructions will keep getting updated. This is just a rough draft at the moment.
